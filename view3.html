You keep overwhelming me
You keep on rushing in, and I can't breathe
Suffocating over you
And I can't escape I'm in too deep
This must be the way it feels
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
        </div>

        <div class="lyrics-text">
          <div class="heading">Hook</div>
          This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
        </div>

        <div class="lyrics-text">
          <div class="heading">Verse</div>
          I can feel the tide is rushing in
But I'm incapable to break the waves
Like all of me is tied to an anchor
And I can't let go
This must be the way it feels, mmm
When I'm drowning
When I'm drowning
        </div>

        <div class="lyrics-text">
          <div class="heading">Hook</div>
          This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
This must be the way it feels
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
When you're drowning
When you're drowning

          Whoa, ooo whoa
Whoa, ooo whoa
This must be, this must be the way
This must be, this must be the way
This must be, this must be the way it feels, (Whoa, ooo whoa)
This must be, this must be the way
This must be, this must be the way
This must be, this must be the way it feels, (Whoa, ooo whoa)
The way it feels
