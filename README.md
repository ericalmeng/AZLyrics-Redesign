Ttitle: AZLyrics-Redesign

Team: Erica Meng, Kaylin Le, Lillian Ji

Idea: Redesign the actual website of AZLyrics into a minimalist and modern look. We improve the aesthetic appeal of the
websiteâ€™s layouts, give certain elements (such as the navigation bar) more emphasis, and in
general make the website more appealing to users. More information can be found in writeup.pdf
